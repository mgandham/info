this is Manu. Years ago I dreamt that Earth was flooding over. I was trapped in a house with water rising rapidly around me. I stood on a desk and realized that everyone I ever knew and loved was dead. I thought this was the end. Searchlights appeared in the window and I was rescued by government agents. I was informed that humanity would survive this calamity by settling a new planet far, far away. To my utter bewilderment I was boarded onto the Ark: a massive spacecraft full of survivors ready to depart Earth. As the final countdown took place, the atmosphere aboard the ship was jubilant and euphoric. The Ark was evidently our home for the indefinite future, and everyone was ready to celebrate like college freshman, thankful for deliverance from reality and responsibility. I felt completely alienated from the joyous rabble. Amidst the roaring of thrusters I looked out a window and saw the surface of the planet below, dense with debris and waterlogged beyond recovery. It would have no meaning to anyone anymore, just a remnant from the past, something for the history books. Looking up I saw something I will never forget: another Ark. So incredibly gargantuan but launching from so many miles away on Earth's surface that I could finally see the mysterious spacecraft in its entirety. It was an elongated square bipyramid standing on its tip, pushing slowly into space. I knew that there were people I loved aboard that ship. this was just the beginning
