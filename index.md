adult sperm whales surfacing to check on their calves off the coast of the Azores islands of Portugal: Simply the most amazing thing I've seen recently. The Azores are supposed to be an excellent destination for pelagic animal encounters, and diving with whales is possibly the top thing on my bucket list.

this morning I woke up naturally at 8:30 am. The lights in my brain turned on and I felt well-rested, but part of me wanted to continue sleeping and avoid the commitments of the day ahead. I figured it was okay for me to sleep in longer since I was still a student with no real responsibilities. Content with this line of reasoning, I seamlessly drifted into a half-asleep state. In my mind's eye I found a neatly folded scrap of parchment. It was a message to myself, from me. I opened it. In caligraphy, it said: "Wake Up." I crumpled up the parchment and tossed it in the direction of a freshly manifested wastebasket. The crumpled paper ball bounced off a white brick wall and arced neatly into the bin. Bank shot

the train doors closed in my face just as I was about to board. There was a frenzy of frantic energy exchanged between me, the woman standing next to me, and the slack-jawed passengers on the other side of the doors who had made it in and were now pawing at the glass hoping the doors would magically open. Everyone had panic in their eyes and pain in their souls for me and my apparent predicament. The train left the station and suddenly there was emptiness and silence. Chaos and confusion lingered but new emotions now surged forth to fill the space.

"That's never happened to me before," I remarked wistfully. I wasn't necesarily speaking to her, just to myself as I tried to make sense of the landscape of trauma swirling around us. "I'm sorry, I'm just so mad right now," she said to me. The resentment and anger seeping from her seams was unmistakable in the vacuum of the subway station. Above all else there was misery. I didn't say anything, just smiled because it was understandable and I felt sorry for her. I silently cursed myself for not trying to push my way onto the train more aggressively when I had the chance.

My date that evening was nice and kind and pretty. It was my first time meeting someone from a dating app. In the end it didn't amount to anything more than some good conversation and pasta. Perhaps I should have shoved those people aside to get onboard the train. Anyway, she was a Slytherin

the best part of living in New York City is being swept into a frenzy of passion and activity no matter where you go. There's a sense of unity and joint purpose that drives everyone around you into taking another step forward. New York City has a well-established identity as "The City that Never Sleeps," and once you're here, you're adopted into that ethos. When I visited my sister in Washington D.C. she told me that she experienced a similar sense of unity with the average passer-by, a fact which she chalked up to the identity of D.C. as a city of political activists and leaders. Generalizations can empower people with a sense of purpose and camaraderie. Evoking a sense of identity is a good way to enagage users, and in constructing a platform for geo-local engagement I hope to do something useful for my country as a whole. I want people to feel connected to the places they live and accept and understand one another. Our perspectives are functions of our locales and upbringings and I want a platform that brings those relationships to the forefront of conversation. we are one

when confronted with tragic news, I feel it on the inside and don't know what to say or do on the outside. My life has been free of misfortune and I don't know how to console or comfort someone in pain. Instead I cling to the hope that my internal anguish does something to make the world a better place. But obviously it doesn't. Getting older means people die and internalizing emotions is not a sustainable solution to dealing with grief. Here are articles memorializing the recent passing of students at Columbia University: rest in peace

this is Manu. Years ago I dreamt that Earth was flooding over. I was trapped in a house with water rising rapidly around me. I stood on a desk and realized that everyone I ever knew and loved was dead. I thought this was the end. Searchlights appeared in the window and I was rescued by government agents. I was informed that humanity would survive this calamity by settling a new planet far, far away. To my utter bewilderment I was boarded onto the Ark: a massive spacecraft full of survivors ready to depart Earth. As the final countdown took place, the atmosphere aboard the ship was jubilant and euphoric. The Ark was evidently our home for the indefinite future, and everyone was ready to celebrate like college freshman, thankful for deliverance from reality and responsibility. I felt completely alienated from the joyous rabble. Amidst the roaring of thrusters I looked out a window and saw the surface of the planet below, dense with debris and waterlogged beyond recovery. It would have no meaning to anyone anymore, just a remnant from the past, something for the history books. Looking up I saw something I will never forget: another Ark. So incredibly gargantuan but launching from so many miles away on Earth's surface that I could finally see the mysterious spacecraft in its entirety. It was an elongated square bipyramid standing on its tip, pushing slowly into space. I knew that there were people I loved aboard that ship. this was just the beginning
