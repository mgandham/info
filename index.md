when confronted with tragic news, I feel it on the inside and don't know what to say or do on the outside. My life has been free of misfortune and I don't know how to console or comfort someone in pain. Instead I cling to the hope that my internal anguish does something to make the world a better place. But obviously it doesn't. Getting older means people die and internalizing emotions is not a sustainable solution to dealing with grief. Here are articles memorializing the recent passing of students at Columbia University: rest in peace

I stood on a desk and realized that everyone I ever knew and loved was dead. I thought this was the end. Searchlights appeared in the window and I was rescued by government agents. I was informed that humanity would survive this calamity by settling a new planet far, far away. To my utter bewilderment I was boarded onto the Ark: a massive spacecraft full of survivors ready to depart Earth. As the final countdown took place, the atmosphere aboard the ship was jubilant and euphoric. The Ark was evidently our home for the indefinite future, and everyone was ready to celebrate like college freshman, thankful for deliverance from reality and responsibility. I felt completely alienated from the joyous rabble. Amidst the roaring of thrusters I looked out a window and saw the surface of the planet below, dense with debris and waterlogged beyond recovery. It would have no meaning to anyone anymore, just a remnant from the past, something for the history books. Looking up I saw something I will never forget: another Ark. So incredibly gargantuan but launching from so many miles away on Earth's surface that I could finally see the mysterious spacecraft in its entirety. It was an elongated square bipyramid standing on its tip, pushing slowly into space. I knew that there were people I loved aboard that ship. this was just the beginning
