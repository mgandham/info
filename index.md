vibes.guide is up and I'm very happy to have an outlet for writing that is empty of any meaning or narrative. And yet how can I ignore the narrative that is real life? I got a Sharpie tattoo of a pirate skull and it has already fused into my being. I'm cooking spicy ass Thai food and now things are getting heated to the point where I can justify brewing Thai iced tea, and I am excited about my developing culinary skill set. I'm not ignoring my inherent tendencies but channeling them instead

The Rendering Core was a supercomputer more powerful than any artificial intelligence in existence, and yet it wasn't even a real object. The inner circuits of the Rendering Core lay deep within the mind of the Architect, accessible to him only while dreaming. Getting the Core up and running had not been an easy feat, as the device required a massive amount of processing horsepower. The Architect experimented with massive parallel computing systems at first but nothing seemed to provide the amount of computing ability required. He experimented with massive installations, warehouses linked with one another across wide swathes of the conintental U.S.A., computing facilities one after another, connected for as far as the eye could see, so wide a plane was needed to travel from one end of the Rendering Core to the other. Nothing worked. After a while The Architect found the amount of space needed for his creation to be realized was unfathomable. Unable to conceive the size and scale of his creation prevented him from being able to operate it, as vast portions would unexpectedly black out and his simulations would be crude and fragile.

One day after another failed simulation, The Architect deviated from his mission and flew into space. He took a classic iconic spacecraft, an X-Wing, into orbit, since it was simply the most readily available option. His head hurt. He began to meditate and looked out the cockpit at Earth sprawling below him. The size and scale of the planet shifted into focus for him and below he could see a neverending grid that was his latest iteration of the Rendering Core. Suddenly the resolution of the simulation increased. He felt the various loads on the Rendering Core becoming lifted as frozen portions of the computer came back online. He knew what must be done for the next version of the Core.

The next iteration of The Rendering Core wasn't based in Yellowstone National Park, as before. It was in orbit around the Earth. Finally the Architect had conceived of a design so vast and immense that it had the power to render any simulation, and yet the simplicity to be fully envisioned by his lucid consciousness while asleep. Stacks and stacks of the latest top-of-the-line GPUs, loaded into shipping containers, were linked together by cables into Ring Units. The Ring Units were stacked against each other in zero-gravity forming a massive ring encircling Earth. Running 24 hours a day, powered by it's own inertial motion, the Rendering Core was laborious constructed with leviathan lifting ships that brought the storage containers into orbit. Teams of workers were brought into space to keep the facility running at all times. They lived and worked and existed in space. Regular shuttles to and from the surface kept morale up for everyone

simply the most amazing thing I've seen recently: Adult sperm whales rising from the depths to join their calves off the coast of the Azores islands of Portugal. The Azores are supposed to be an excellent destination for pelagic animal encounters, and diving with whales is possibly the top thing on my bucket list. It's only a matter of time!

this morning I woke up naturally at 8:30 am. The lights in my brain turned on and I felt well-rested, but part of me wanted to continue sleeping and avoid the commitments of the day ahead. I figured it was okay for me to sleep in longer since I was still a student with no real responsibilities. Content with this line of reasoning, I seamlessly drifted into a half-asleep state. In my mind's eye I found a neatly folded scrap of parchment. It was a message to myself, from me. I opened it. In caligraphy, it said: "Wake Up." I crumpled up the parchment and tossed it in the direction of a freshly manifested wastebasket. The crumpled paper ball bounced off a white brick wall and arced neatly into the bin. Bank shot

the train doors closed in my face just as I was about to board. There was a frenzy of frantic energy exchanged between me, the woman standing next to me, and the slack-jawed passengers on the other side of the doors who had made it in and were now pawing at the glass hoping the doors would magically open. Everyone had panic in their eyes and pain in their souls for me and my apparent predicament. The train left the station and suddenly there was emptiness and silence. Chaos and confusion lingered but new emotions now surged forth to fill the space.

"That's never happened to me before," I remarked wistfully. I wasn't necesarily speaking to her, just to myself as I tried to make sense of the landscape of trauma swirling around us. "I'm sorry, I'm just so mad right now," she said to me. The resentment and anger seeping from her seams was unmistakable in the vacuum of the subway station. Above all else there was misery. I didn't say anything, just smiled because it was understandable and I felt sorry for her. I silently cursed myself for not trying to push my way onto the train more aggressively when I had the chance.

My date that evening was nice and kind and pretty. It was my first time meeting someone from a dating app. In the end it didn't amount to anything more than some good conversation and pasta. Perhaps I should have shoved those people aside to get onboard the train. Anyway, she was a Slytherin

the best part of living in New York City is being swept into a frenzy of passion and activity no matter where you go. There's a sense of unity and joint purpose that drives everyone around you into taking another step forward. New York City has a well-established identity as "The City that Never Sleeps," and once you're here, you're adopted into that ethos. When I visited my sister in Washington D.C. she told me that she experienced a similar sense of unity with the average passer-by, a fact which she chalked up to the identity of D.C. as a city of political activists and leaders. Generalizations can empower people with a sense of purpose and camaraderie. Evoking a sense of identity is a good way to enagage users, and in constructing a platform for geo-local engagement I hope to do something useful for my country as a whole. I want people to feel connected to the places they live and accept and understand one another. Our perspectives are functions of our locales and upbringings and I want a platform that brings those relationships to the forefront of conversation. we are one

when confronted with tragic news, I feel it on the inside and don't know what to say or do on the outside. My life has been free of misfortune and I don't know how to console or comfort someone in pain. Instead I cling to the hope that my internal anguish does something to make the world a better place. But obviously it doesn't. Getting older means people die and internalizing emotions is not a sustainable solution to dealing with grief. Here are articles memorializing the recent passing of students at Columbia University: rest in peace

this is Manu. Years ago I dreamt that Earth was flooding over. I was trapped in a house with water rising rapidly around me. I stood on a desk and realized that everyone I ever knew and loved was dead. I thought this was the end. Searchlights appeared in the window and I was rescued by government agents. I was informed that humanity would survive this calamity by settling a new planet far, far away. To my utter bewilderment I was boarded onto the Ark: a massive spacecraft full of survivors ready to depart Earth. As the final countdown took place, the atmosphere aboard the ship was jubilant and euphoric. The Ark was evidently our home for the indefinite future, and everyone was ready to celebrate like college freshman, thankful for deliverance from reality and responsibility. I felt completely alienated from the joyous rabble. Amidst the roaring of thrusters I looked out a window and saw the surface of the planet below, dense with debris and waterlogged beyond recovery. It would have no meaning to anyone anymore, just a remnant from the past, something for the history books. Looking up I saw something I will never forget: another Ark. So incredibly gargantuan but launching from so many miles away on Earth's surface that I could finally see the mysterious spacecraft in its entirety. It was an elongated square bipyramid standing on its tip, pushing slowly into space. I knew that there were people I loved aboard that ship. this was just the beginning
